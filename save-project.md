# Save Project

![](gifs/save.gif)

Click on the menu circle -> and save.
You can choose between downloading the .js file or copy its content to clipboard.

The saved file is always a simple .js include into your app.
This .js contains
  - your animations (defined with UMD)
  - the editor information
  - all of its dependencies (except GSAP)
*The last two should be optional and it will be so you can have smaller files for production*
